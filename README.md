Documenting learning Python

About Me:
  Ricky, Hi hello, not much to say about myself here, picking up Python again after    forgetting a lot of it

Goals for the course:
  Deeper understanding of OOP, hope to use it to finish an idea I've had for a personal project. 

Code Block:
```
print("Hello World")
```
